         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For without the former condition, to wit, an undoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted knowledge of them, no man can ſecurely rely on any doctrine contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in them; and without the latter condition of being rightly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood,

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:119657:9"/> and who can doubt but that Chriſts Church might better from them Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, than from the Jews come to know true Scriptures.</p>

That ſome ancient Fathers alſo, when many for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged Scriptures were extant, &amp; not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh'd from canonical writings
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:119657:9"/> doubted of, or denied the authority of ſome Books admitted by us, is an argument that proveth over much, or juſt nothing: for that we know many undoubted parts of Scripture have been queſtioned in a lik<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>She is called holy as the myſticall body of Chriſt vivificated by his holy Spirit, governed by a holy Law, ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified by Sacraments continually by him, having none but faithfull ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of their divine Lord remaining within her, amongſt whom there are ſtill to be found, many holy Perſons; whileſt others are like fruitleſſe bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in a Vine and dead members in a living body.</p>

               <p>Wherefore our Adverſaries fly from thoſe ancient marks of a true Church, and aſſign two others of their own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſing, true preaching of Gods word, and a due adminiſtration of Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, againſt which we object firſt, that the eſſence rather than the ſig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Thirdly, that any man, deſirous to be a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, muſt firſt know the Church, before he can know the truth of her Doctrine <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Fourthly, that this judgement of the Churches true doctrine, and due manner of adminiſtration of Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, cannot be made by ordinary perſons, but by ſuch as are learned; whereas the ſign<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Which Queſtion had been better made by ſome Infidel, than any Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Authour of learning or judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment propoſed: for who knoweth not that pure Spirits (ſuch as are ſouls ſeparated from bodies) have a ſpiritual manner both of hearing and ſpeaking without ears, tongue, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther corporall ſenſes: ſo as it would be no abſurd thing, if I ſhould tell <hi>Calvin,</hi> that Lucifer in hell knew him very well, and ſuch Hereſies as were to the ruine of ſouls broached by him, albeit he had no eyes to view his papers, or ears to hear his Doctrines preached, by the naturall light of his underſtanding in abſence alſo pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated by him; which is as ears and

            <p>Neither doth this Mediation of Saints derogate any thing at all from the mediation of Chriſt: For that he immediately by himſelf and in the right of his own merits advocateth and obtaineth at his fathers hands what graces he will himſelf, and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings for us.

For example in the third book, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly affirmeth that there can be no juſtice of faith, but where good works and the opinion of merit gained by by them are excluded. Albeit before <note place="margin">c. 17. n. 1.</note> in his ſecond book he had blamed the overmuch niceneſs of ſome, who albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it they acknowledge us by Chriſts me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits to be redeemed, yet love they not to hear the name of merit pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiving his grace to be obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by it: But (ſaith he) Chriſts merits <note place="margin">lib. 3. cap. 15. n. 3.</note> are fooliſhly oppoſed to Gods mercy for betweene ſubalternated things, there is no oppoſition, Gods mercy, to wit, in freely juſtifying us, and
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:119657:90"/> his Sons meriting ſuch mercy for us.

Are there no merits (ſaith S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi>) of juſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons? <note place="margin">Epiſt. 105. ad Sixtum.</note> Yes, aſſuredly becauſe they are juſt; but that they are juſt, proceeded not of their own merits; for where grace precedeth not, merits cannot follow or be gained by any man: ſo as when God rewardeth our works, <note place="margin">Epist. 46.</note> he crowneth his own mereies in us, and he maketh himſelf indebted to us, not by receiving any thing from us
<note place="margin">in pſal. 83.</note> but by promiſing to reward our acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons done for his ſervice.</p>
            <p>And in this ſence we affirm all worth and merit of our Actions to proceed from Chriſt, and that union which by Faith and grace we have with him; as branches in a Vine receive all growth and fruitfulneſſe from it; whileſt he infuſeth his holy ſpirit into
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:119657:90"/> us, according to that of the Apoſtle, <hi>the charity of God is diffuſed into our bearts by the holy Ghoſt, who is given unto us;</hi> whereby we become the adopted chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, and brethren of Chriſt, as partaking the ſame ſpirit with him, and come ſo to have a right unto a heavenly inheritance purchaſed for us by him. Being likewiſe raiſed to ſo high a dignity, our actions as done by Gods adopted children, and with help of grace, become dignified alſo in the value of them, and worthy of that reward which God hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed unto them; ſo as from firſt to laſt, Chriſt is the Origine, ſource and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of all merit in them.</p>

<pb n="197" facs="tcp:119657:102"/> to the freedome of their own wills, to ſhew greater mercy unto them, after they have offended him; that his Sons merits may be uſefull in his Church, by being applied to the remiſſion of mens ſins by Sacraments, for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ordained by him, whoſe incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was by <hi>Adams</hi> ſin, as the Church ſingeth on <hi>Eaſter</hi> Eve, happily occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned; Bleſſedly therefore permitted by God, not abſolutely willed or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed by him, as is by <hi>Calvin</hi> falſly and wickedly affirmed: from whoſe patient loving and mercifull proceedings to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Sinners, here in this world, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they have often and hainouſly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended him, we may well gather how far he is now, and ever he hath been from haſting his judgments, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighting himſelf in executing the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour of his juſtice on them, according to <hi>Calvins</hi> doctrine; againſt which we Catholicks deny not Gods Predeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Reprobation of Souls to be chief parts of his generall Providence over Creatures, to their ſeverall ends directed by him: but acknowledge that by the ſormer, all ordained to ſalvation are certainly ſaved by him,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:119657:103"/> and by the latter others are no leſſe certainly damned: the one is an Act of Gods mercy freely and graciouſly without any deſert at all unto ſome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>above others afforded by him, and the other is an act of Juſtice, and a will to puniſh ſuch as have offended him, that is the Origin and Source of all bleſſings and meanes of attaining ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation for us in this life prepared, as St. <hi>Auſtine</hi> hath defined it. The other is the cauſe not of ſin (as <hi>Calvin</hi> affirmed) but of all pain and puniſhment due to it, that is of Gods free election, not ſuppoſing any good in our ſelves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it: but this other is neither de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed nor inflicted by God, all good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs &amp; mercy, but for ſome evill for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly committed. Thoſe were not more worthy or better diſpoſed to be choſen by God, than theſe other, who made themſelves worthy by their ill deeds to be damned by him.</p>
            <p>As thoſe by congruous &amp; effectuall graces are holpen unto their lives end to attain Salvation, ſo theſe others want not ſufficient graces, &amp; helps to be ſaved with a free liberty of their
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:119657:103"/> wills to make uſe accordingly of them. God for his part doth moſt ſeriouſly exhort, command, by threats likewiſe and promiſes ſeek to draw ſinners unto him out of a will to ſave them; ſo as it muſt be imputed unto themſelves, when for their ſins they juſtly deſerve to be damned by him. And to conclude this doctrine, as a crown is prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red according to the merit of such, as are free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly predeſtinated &amp; choſen, ſo are puniſhments prepar'd &amp; inflicted on thoſe, who are reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted &amp; not choſen, as by wicked facts they have deſerv'd them. And herein conſiſts the abyſſall depth of Gods mercy to ward his elect, that in a like eſtate of damnation incurr'd by all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, he will have mercy of ſome to ſave them, and not of others according to his high plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure without any wrong at all done to them.</p>
            <p>This doctrine deſtroyes the dilemma, or mad arguument of ſome careleſs of their eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſalvation. Either I am predeſtinated or not? If I bee, ſure I am, let me doe what I will, to be ſaved. If I be not, let me live ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo holily, ſure I am to be damned: becauſe nether part of this collection is true; for if thou art predeſtinated to glory, it muſt be by living well, and ſerving God as thou ſhould'ſt do: and if thou faileſt in doing ſo, thou mayſt
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:119657:104"/> aſſure thy ſelf that thou art predeſtinated, nor canſt thou have any hope to be ſaved. And if thou art not predeſtinated, thou ſhalt, I deny not, certainly be d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And this free election and predeſtination of ſome, and not of others to grace &amp; glory, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Leaving his ſecret judgements unto God himſelf with love and veneration, and without overcuriouſly diving into them, ſo reſolved, that during their life (whatſoever ſhall happen unto them afterwards) they will ſtrive as they can, by the help of his grace to pleaſe, love and ſerve him.</p>
